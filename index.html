 <h1> Happy Birthday! <br></h1>
  <strong>Sinthia Afrin Simi</strong> 🌸<br><br>
        Some people come into our lives quietly, but leave an echo that never fades — you’re one of them. 
        You’re not just my cousin; you’re a part of my heart’s playlist, the calm after every storm, and the spark that reminds me what true connection feels like.<br><br>
        May this new chapter of your life bring more peace than noise, more meaning than moments, and more smiles than reasons.<br>
        Keep being the kind soul who carries light in her thoughts and strength in her silence.<br>
        You deserve not just a beautiful day — but a beautiful life.<br><br>
        Happy birthday to someone who means more than words can ever explain. 💖✨<br>
        <em>Birthdate: 26 October</em>
